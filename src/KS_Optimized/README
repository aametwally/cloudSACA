Prerequisites:
----------------
To run the algorithm on local machine, you should Install and Configure MPI on all Nodes. Under Debian you need to install the following packages:
1- openmpi-bin
2- openmpi-common
3- libopenmpi1.3
4- libopenmpi-dev (Not actually needed for a slave node.)
5- SSH-Client
6- SSH-Server

How to install the required packages:
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi1.3 libopenmpi-dev openssh-client openssh-server


How to run the KS_Optimized algorithm:
------------------------------
A) make
B) mpirun -np <no_cores> --hostfile <path-to-host-file> ./KS_Optimized <reference-file> [options]



Implemented options:
----------------------
1) -v      Verbose
2) -o      Outputfile --- The default is called SA.txt and found in the same directory.


Examples:
----------
A) If you want to run on local machine:
mpirun -np 4 ./KS_Optimized  Hgchr22.fa -v -o Hgchr22_SA

B) If you want to run on computer cluster:
mpirun -np 16 --hostfile MPI.hosts ./KS_Optimized  Hgchr22.fa -v -o Hgchr22_SA
